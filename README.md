#### Raw query is really fast, you can do things which is not possible in most ORM such as procedures, views etc.

But keeping long term in mind ORM takeover!
Yes sometime we need to compromise speed keeping flexibility in mind. Yes, I am comparing Raw Query as speed and ORM as flexibility.
And if you need speed in ORM then then IMPROVE YOUR HARDWARE.
There are many hardware changes you can do to improve your app performance. I encourage you to google it.

##### In my personal opinion i prefer ORM.
For Many reason such as i do not want to repeat myself, make code management easy, flexibility and much more.
Sometime preference changes on bases of project which we undergo. But those are rare scenario.

In this chapter we will talk more about ORM and also we will integrate one of the best available in PHP Community.
